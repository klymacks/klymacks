I'm working on creating a PayID at klymacks/klymacks.github.io that you can now test with XRP and BTC by inputing "pay$klymacks.github.io" into the send field for BTC and XRP wallet transactions. No need to send funds to test functionality. Any generous donations will be used for further development projects.
